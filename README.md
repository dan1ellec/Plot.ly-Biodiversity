# Plot.ly Biodiversity Project


## Task

To build an interactive dashboard that explores the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonise human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.


## Tools and Technologies

- Javascript
- HTML
- Plotly
- D3


## Dashboard

The dashboard contains three charts and a panel of sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information. These update every time a new sample number is selected from a dropdown menu.

### 1: Horizontal Bar Chart

### 2: Bubble Chart


### 3: Gauge Chart


### Metadata Panel






## Viewing

The project is deployed at https://dan1ellec.github.io/biodiversity_dashboard/
